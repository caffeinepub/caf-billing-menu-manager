# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Clear all existing order and sales records from the backend so the Simple Sips Cafe app starts fresh with zero historical data, while keeping all menu items intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all finalized order and sales records from backend storage
- Ensure daily summary, item-wise sales, and date-wise sales views display empty/zero states after the reset

**User-visible outcome:** All sales report views show ₹0 revenue and empty tables, while all menu items remain intact and new orders can be placed normally.
