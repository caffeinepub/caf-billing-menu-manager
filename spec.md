# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the "Non-Alcoholic Beverages" prefix from the Tea and Coffee category display names throughout the app.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the display name of the Tea category to show simply "Tea" (removing "Non-Alcoholic Beverages") wherever category names are rendered in the frontend (Order tab category grid, menu sections, item forms, etc.)
- Update the display name of the Coffee category to show simply "Coffee" (removing "Non-Alcoholic Beverages") in the same locations

**User-visible outcome:** The Tea and Coffee categories appear with clean, short names throughout the app without the "Non-Alcoholic Beverages" label attached.
