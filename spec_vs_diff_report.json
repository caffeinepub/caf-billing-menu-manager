  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by introducing a getCategoryDisplayName utility function and a CATEGORY_DISPLAY_NAMES map that strip 'Non-Alcoholic Beverages' from Tea and Coffee display names, while preserving the underlying backend category keys. Changes are applied in MenuCategorySection.tsx (menu sections), and the file summaries indicate MenuItemForm.tsx and useQueries.ts also use the display name mapping, covering the Order tab category grid and item forms. No other categories appear affected.",
