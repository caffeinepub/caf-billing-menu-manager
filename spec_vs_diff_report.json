  "summary": "The diff implements a migration module that clears all order/sales records while preserving menu items, and wires it into the backend actor. This directly addresses REQ-18. The migration.mo sets orders to an empty list while keeping menuItems intact, and main.mo applies the migration on upgrade. The project_state.json is updated to reflect version 19. All core acceptance criteria appear addressed: orders cleared, menu items preserved, and sales views would show empty/zero states after the reset.",
