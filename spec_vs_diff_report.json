  "summary": "All four requirements are implemented in the diff. REQ-14 is addressed by removing taxRate/taxAmount from useOrderState.ts and removing the tax input/line from OrderTotalsPanel.tsx. REQ-15 is addressed by removing the tax row from BillLayout.tsx. REQ-16 is addressed by updating backend/main.mo to compute total as subtotal minus discount (no tax) and adding backend/migration.mo to migrate existing records. REQ-17 is addressed by reducing DailySummaryCard.tsx to only two stat cards (revenue and items sold). No missing requirements or hallucinated features were detected.",
