  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-1 by fixing the backend menu loading issue and frontend handling. The backend now uses getAllMenuItems() with client-side grouping (avoiding ICP query-cannot-mutate-state issues), adds auto-seed logic in both MenuManagement.tsx and OrderTaking.tsx, and the backend initializeMenu() function seeds default items. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed. One minor hallucinated feature was identified: a migration module was added that was not requested.",

    {
      "description": "A migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added with a run function and OldActor/NewActor type definitions, and the backend actor was annotated with (with migration = Migration.run).",
      "reason": "The build request only asked to fix the menu failing to load. No migration of existing canister state was mentioned or requested. This is extra infrastructure not specified in REQ-1 or any acceptance criterion.",
